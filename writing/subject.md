Ever found yourself pondering about the difference between blond and blonde? Or about why there is a difference to begin with? For starters, it is important to note that the English language has lived through quite a bit of history. It has connections with the French, Dutch, and even Japanese languages. "Blonde" and "blond" were derived from the French language. The French added the letter E to the end of their words to imply the subject's gender. In this case, "blonde" is referring to female, as "blond" is referring to male. The same goes for "brunet" and "brunette".

To simplify things:

blond = male

blonde = female

brunet = male

brunette = female

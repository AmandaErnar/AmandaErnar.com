<article><h1>Donatella</h1>
  <p>Written: 9/12/21</p>
  <p>She thought of her life in school, and why she dropped out in the eleventh grade. She really shouldn’t have. If she stayed in school, she probably would’ve not turned out as she was.</p>
<p>Her hands tore through the pockets of her gown and pulled out her I.D.—the one she pickpocketed from a random South American at the airport. Rosa Chandler, DOB: April 7, 1999, it read, and Donatella heaved a long sigh. Poor Rosa.</p>
<p>She clenched her jaw and stood herself up on the creaking platform, noticing the sweaty film her palms were coated in.</p>
<p>Her ears tried picking up on the sputters of French exchanged between lovers and the distant squawks of the gulls which vexed her in the mornings, but the streets were shrouded in a heavy silence.</p>
<p>She was practically naked—clothed in only a thin nightgown, a flimsy little thing. Just how long had she stood there for? Donatella asked herself, feeling a surge of warmth rush into her cheeks. She covered herself in the inadequate protection of her arms and hurried into the safe harbors of her hotel room. </p>
<p>Humming to herself, Donatella clothed herself in threads of satin and loose denim, adjusting her collar and stopping to thread a leather belt through the loops of her jeans. She had always found the process of getting dressed quite relaxing.</p>
<p>As a child would, Donatella enjoyed dressing up and posing in front of the mirror. She smiled peevishly, gazing astutely at her reflection. She tried her best not to think of how her shoulders and hips stuck out like heaps of unkneaded dough.</p>
<p>There was a knock at her door.</p>
<p>The knocking continued, pulsing with a rhythm she knew all too well. Her smile faltered. She knew exactly who stood before her door, probably gnawing on his nails or brushing his feet against the doormat. Slowly, Donatella made her way over to her door and creaked it open.</p>
<p>“Ah, Chris,” she sang. “Welcome.” Christopher Russel, an old friend of Donatella’s, smiled stiffly as he stepped into the hotel room, his hand lingering suspiciously behind his back. Donatella grinned as she shut the door behind him. She noticed the hairs on his forearm standing upright as if he were about to have a stroke. </p>
<p>Chris was a visually-offensive looking man that dressed as if he were in his forties. His sandy hair was slicked back with gel, and his limbs were slender and inept. It confused Donatella, how an innocent-seeming man happened to stumble upon and get tangled up in her chaotic mess. She remembered the day they met—four years ago, when he was still an uptight high schooler suffering from a serious drug addiction. It was her friend, Caleb, that introduced him to her.</p>
<p>“Are you aware,” he cleared his throat, “of what I’m here for?”</p>
<p>Donatella’s grin only grew wider. Of course she knew.</p>
<p>She watched calmly as he scrutinized the hotel room, which was currently in shambles. “…Do you think… if everything happens for a reason, is it possible to predict future events?” He asked, probably to stall for time, before he could unsheathe the gun behind his back. Kenny had flown him across the Atlantic to kill her, so why was he hesitating? He was probably pissing himself.</p>
<p>“Oh, Chris, you haven’t changed at all!”</p>
<p>Chris felt the fingers in his left pocket dig into his pants, into the frenzy of coins and crumpled S-Mart receipts he had stuffed in there weeks ago, and he could taste his beating heart from the back of his throat. Then, after a moment of hesitation, he finally struck.</p>
<p>He snapped a handgun out of his pocket and pointed it at Donatella, his veins pulsing with adrenaline. Their gazes met, and Donatella brought her hands to her ears, slowly dropping to her knees. Her thin and colorless smile sent a frigid chill down Chris’ spine.</p>
<p>The gun was a pretty little thing, slick and black and adorned with leather. She pictured her slender fingers threaded through the trigger, its leather grip brushing gently up against her palm. In fact, it was so pretty, Donatella knew exactly who had shipped it to him. Or, rather, she wondered where in France he had purchased a pretty thing like that. </p>
<p>“It’s been years, and you’re still Kenny’s doormat. I bet you like that, huh? You like him wiping his feet and stepping all over you,” she laughed.</p>
<p>“What makes you think,” his voice cracked, “that I can’t pull the trigger right now?” Donatella cocked her head to the side and let out a laugh. He could not.</p>
<p>She stood and sauntered a couple steps in his direction until the gun’s muzzle was pressed against her forehead, drawing a strange pattern on her skin. “Do it.”</p></article></main>

It unravels itself.

Its feathers, white like an angelâ€™s satin gown,

Sway back and forth in the light breeze like bobs on a silver pendulum,

Finally going still.

Its feet, gaunt and dissolute like the limber stems of white roses,

Step lightly on the boundless weed-choked country road,

Finally undertaking the shrouded veil of the dark forest.

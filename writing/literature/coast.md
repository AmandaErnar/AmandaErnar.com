"What keeps you up at night?" I found myself asking, my heart abuzz in my throat.

Thalia said nothing, only gazing past me, into the sky, a creamy cobalt. The ocean lurked behind, the moonlight misting its crisp waters. Its waves crashed back and forth against the black searocks. I washed myself in their terse sounds, watching Thalia's eyes meet mine.

She seemed to be in a daze. It was like something was keeping her from speaking with me. "What's the matter?" I asked, pocketing my hands.

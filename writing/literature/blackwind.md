The blackwind tormented us as our feet dragged along the narrow, weed-choked path. Its song was queer yet familiar, tickling the bottoms of our stomachs and dousing them with dread. The sky seemed to be blacker and slicker than oil drawn freshly from the earth. The moon was there, its one half wan, the other set aglow with a garish yellow haze.

My lips were drier than summer farmland. My lungs drew in breath after breath, the honeysuckle wind of the west. I could feel the water jug dangling impishly from my shoulder gradually grow lighter as bits of it came dribbling out. Wet beads of perspiration slid down my cheek as I stepped forth towards what I called my home, although it really didn't feel that way.

"Aris," sang my mother, her lips darker than freshly spilled blood. The corners of her lips twisted upward with every step I took to approach her. There was a leather saddlebag flung over her shoulder and she wore a cream-colored dress falling elegantly to her ankles, bringing out her slender figure. There were silver coins dangling from her ears and a turquoise bead fitted around her ring finger. "It was about time you arrived."

"Heard from father yet?" I asked, setting my knapsack down against our stone dwelling, unbuttoning the sweater I had on over my tunic. The moon was high, yet it was humid outside.

I watched my mother's lips tighten with the thought of my father. "It seems he won't be coming back soon, Aris. Go bathe and eat with your siblings. There's porridge from the other night in the kitchen."

My expression must have faltered as I walked in. Instantly, I was welcomed by the sultry scents of arid jasmine and eaglewood, the hollowness of sound free from the blackwind. I hung my sweater over the sandalwood banister and stepped over to the hearth, my eyes closing themselves at the sound of crackling hearth.

The footsteps behind me were like the cracks of the Astorgans' whips. I turned and saw my sister, Lorelei, sit herself down next to me. Her limbs were littered with bruises. Out of everyone in our household, she was the outsider. The bastard. My mother was often harsh with her, but no one said a word about it.

"Do you enjoy watching the flames?" I asked. Lorelei shook her head. She was three years younger than I, yet had more maturity than any of the others in our family. I didn't understand how she had brought herself to love our mother, despite their frequent quarrels.

Eight years ago, my mother had an affair outside of marriage. The story was well-known throughout the village we lived in, carrying itself through the doors of households and shops. It ruined her.

I did not know of Lorelei's father. There was rumor he was a Calae from over in the poverty-stricken land of Tagas, the holy land for Jalinists, Astor. He must have seemed well, since Lorelei didn't look too bad.

"Do you like watching the flames?" asked Lorelei, fumbling with her hands nervously. I hadn't heard her speak in years. Her voice was scratchy with disuse. I smiled as warmly as I could muster. "I do. It relaxes me."

That night, I dreamt of my father. His large hands wrapped around my shoulders, his kind grin.

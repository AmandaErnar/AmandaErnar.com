It felt like the world was holding its breath.

It was the month when fires swept through the dry mountains and clouded the sky in warm gushes of orange, and when my neighbor’s lemon trees were to burst with fruit. That is, if I were still their neighbor.

I recently moved into an apartment situated in the uncanny outskirts of Los Angeles. There was a convenience store and a bank nearby, and the structure was easy to navigate, but I still hated it. It was the cheapest one I could find on the market, and easily the worst. The flowery wallpaper which its brick walls were draped in was chipping away and a layer of dust had been brushed over the creaky floorboards. Oh, and the lighting needed work. There was only one light source in the studio: a flickering lamp that sealed everything in a cool glow, placed ineptly in the kitchen.

But beggars couldn’t be choosers, could they?

I leaned quietly against the edge of my balcony, my fingertips stroking the hoarse overlay of rust that had settled over its parapet. A surge of icy wind brushed up against my skin and sent a chill trickling down my spine. It was getting cold. I was used to the Californian weather—the streets veiled with fog in the morning and the afternoon pavement sizzling with heat. At night, temperatures were colder than you could imagine.

The sky was draped in sweeps of cobalt and the sun dipped seductively into a pool of red, and the streets were unusually still. Having grown up here, I found the silence a little creepy. I couldn’t make out the cracks of guns or illegal fireworks that evening, or the ugly barks of my neighbor’s festering puppy. I could only make out the faint giggles and lisps of white children playing tag on the street.

“Quincy hit me.”

“I’m gonna tell my mom!”

They were supervised by their overweight parents, who I heard sputtering frenziedly from below. I stared down at them from my decrepit balcony, and then their funny little heads turned in unison to look back at me, no longer sputtering and lisping as they did. I tried not to notice.

The mosquitos would come soon, I realized. My earliest memory was waking to a fat, septic mosquito bite on my forearm. It was the last thing I needed right now. I pictured them emerging from their nests and buzzing around my bare arms like they were blocks of rotten fruit.

I had been standing there for what seemed like half an hour, occasionally drawing moony breaths from the warm cigar tucked between my fingers. It sent gentle waves of heat down my fingertips and still glowed faintly with ember.

What time was it?

The cell phone in my left pocket rang, its cracked screen glowing and vibrating with artificial light. What a shitty phone, I thought. I’d save up for a new one.

I really, really needed money.

Presumably, the call was from a certain coworker of mine—and I was right.

“Angel.”

“Where are you?”

“I'm at my house.”

“You're supposed to be at The Grove.”

I was supposed to be at the abandoned shopping mall by the children’s hospital. Sighing, I brought myself back inside and shut the sliding glass door behind me.

“Give me a couple minutes,” I told him, and I hung up.

The studio was small and gave off an overbearing scent of citrus and honey. A jumbo-sized bag of cough drops lay ajar on the kitchen counter.

I snatched the keys to my Prius off the cold kitchen countertop, put on the coat hanging from my wooden chair, and slid out the door. Room number 67, I repeated to myself breathlessly as I shut it,  studying the door’s angled frame and gilt finish. I moved in a couple days ago and still didn’t know which room I lived in. It was embarrassing, actually.

I worked my way down the spiraling staircase by floor three’s broken vending machine, finally stumbling upon the dry courtyard and then the parking lot. I found my car—parked between a Mercedes and a rusty BMW—and brought myself inside.

“I'm actually going to kill myself.” I let someone else drive the other night, and the seat was bent all the way forward.

I suddenly realized I wasn’t a great driver. I managed to pull myself out of the parking lot at least a few minutes after I started the engine. The act of driving my musty Pruis was one I actively tried to avoid, and so was the act of looking out the window and into the filthy driveway. As a matter of fact, I failed my driving test six times before the instructor let me pass.

I couldn't help but notice the queer pine trees, literal inches from my nose as I pulled out of the building. Their long stalks branched out into the sky and spouted nasty yellow leaves out of their fat mantles.

Then, the thought drew the breath out of me: I forgot to lock the door. But I kept speeding along Wyandotte Avenue, because who the hell would bother with room number 67?

—

It took two minutes for me to crash.

Fat, air-filled balloons bursted out from the space in front of me, choking off breath. “Motherfucker,” I cursed under my breath, pushing the white sac out of my face. 

<!-- She thought of her life in school, and why she dropped out in the eleventh grade. She really shouldn't have. If she stayed in school, she probably would’ve not turned out as she was.
Her hands tore through the pockets of her gown and pulled out her I.D.—the one she pickpocketed from a random South American at the airport. Rosa Chandler, DOB: April 7, 1999, it read, and Marie heaved a long sigh. Poor Rosa.

She clenched her jaw and stood herself up on the creaking platform, noticing the sweaty film her palms were coated in.
Her ears tried picking up on the sputters of French exchanged between lovers and the distant squawks of the gulls which vexed her in the mornings, but the streets were shrouded in a heavy silence.
She was practically naked—clothed in only a thin nightgown, a flimsy little thing. Just how long had she stood there for? Marie asked herself, feeling a surge of warmth rush into her cheeks. She covered herself in the inadequate protection of her arms and hurried into the safe harbors of her hotel room. 
Humming to herself, Marie clothed herself in threads of satin and loose denim, adjusting her collar and stopping to thread a leather belt through the loops of her jeans. She had always found the process of getting dressed quite relaxing.
As a child would, Marie enjoyed dressing up and posing in front of the mirror. She smiled peevishly, gazing astutely at her reflection. She tried her best not to think of how her shoulders and hips stuck out like heaps of unkneaded dough.

There was a knock at her door.
The knocking continued, pulsing with a rhythm she knew all too well. Her smile faltered. She knew exactly who stood before her door, probably gnawing on his nails or brushing his feet against the doormat. Slowly, Marie made her way over to her door and creaked it open.

“Ah, Chris,” she sang. “Welcome.” Christopher Russel, an old friend of Marie’s, smiled stiffly as he stepped into the hotel room, his hand lingering suspiciously behind his back. Marie grinned as she shut the door behind him. She noticed the hairs on his forearm standing upright as if he were about to have a stroke. 
Chris was a visually-offensive looking man that dressed as if he were in his forties. His sandy hair was slicked back with gel, and his limbs were slender and inept. It confused Marie, how an innocent-seeming man happened to stumble upon and get tangled up in her chaotic mess. She remembered the day they met—four years ago, when he was still an uptight high schooler suffering from a serious drug addiction. It was her friend, Caleb, that introduced him to her.

“Are you aware,” he cleared his throat, “of what I’m here for?”
Marie’s grin only grew wider. Of course she knew what he had flown all the way from America for.
She watched calmly as he scrutinized the hotel room, which was currently in shambles. “...Do you think… if everything happens for a reason, is it possible to predict future events?” He asked, probably to stall for time, before he could unsheathe the gun behind his back. Kenny had flown him across the Atlantic to kill her, so why was he hesitating? He was probably pissing himself.

“Oh, Chris, you haven’t changed at all!”

Chris felt the fingers in his left pocket dig into his pants, into the frenzy of coins and crumpled S-Mart receipts he had stuffed in there weeks ago, and he could taste his beating heart from the back of his throat. Then, after a moment of hesitation, he finally struck.
He snapped a handgun out of his pocket and pointed it at Marie, his veins pulsing with adrenaline. Their gazes met, and Marie brought her hands to her ears, slowly dropping to her knees. Her thin and colorless smile sent a frigid chill down Chris’ spine.

The gun was a pretty little thing, slick and black and adorned with leather. She pictured her slender fingers threaded through the trigger, its leather grip brushing gently up against her palm. In fact, it was so pretty, Marie knew exactly who had shipped it to him. Or, rather, she wondered where in France he had purchased a pretty thing like that. 
“It’s been years, and you’re still Kenny’s doormat. I bet you like that, huh? You like him wiping his feet and stepping all over you,” she laughed.
“What makes you think,” his voice cracked, “that I can’t pull the trigger right now?” Marie cocked her head to the side and let out a laugh. He could not.
She stood and sauntered a couple steps in his direction until the gun’s muzzle was pressed against her forehead, drawing a strange pattern on her skin. “Do it.” -->

## Alison

It was wildfire season in California. The sky was painted with streaks of scarlet, and the air smelled faintly of ash and charred lumber.

Quinn and Teddy Baines, the ditzy pair of twins living on Yarmouth Avenue, chased each other around their backyard with rubber garden hoses. They ran around the parched turf buoyantly as their hoses spewed icy tap water about the garden. It was hard not to crack a grin at their squeals, but they would soon enter the house and trail mud all over the hardwood.

Their mother, Marta Baines, laughed heartily at the two from the kitchen window as she drew her steaming tray of marinating beef out of the fridge. “Hot as hades,” she mumbled to herself in the frivolous voice of a housewife, wiping the vexing beads of sweat off her forehead. Her every movement was delicate and spry, and she was skinny—far too skinny. She was said by many to have resembled a starved horse.

“James, would you be a dear and turn on the AC?” She asked her bastard, good-for-nothing husband. Her question was met with the distorted sounds of television. And so, the air conditioning system was never turned on until Mrs. Baines herself trudged into the lounge and flipped its switch.

James Baines, her husband, enjoyed his day off work. She found him loafing by the television with a foaming glass of beer in the grip of his palm. Mr. Baines worked an office job 100 hours a week, which had helped him grow a gut and become an alcoholic. He grinned at his wife as the gentle scent of warm spices wafted over to the family room, which was returned with a glare.

Their often-neglected daughter, Alison Baines, had secluded herself in her bedroom, seated at her tiny desk positioned conventionally in the corner. Her sheets were tossed frenziedly into her purple laundry basket, leaving nothing but a bare mattress framed with skinny slabs of wood to rest by her window. Crumbs and pieces of trash littered the surface of her desk, and mounds of unworn clothing lay on her carpet in heaps.

Alison glanced over at the iPhone 8 she received for her twelfth birthday. 4:22PM, it read, and her head fell back onto her desk. Another day had gone by, and she had accomplished close to nothing since the beginning of summer vacation. A long breath eluded her lips as her ears were satiated with an odyssey of sound. The act of listening to music at noon had its way of clearing her mind and easing her temperament, which she looked forward to on days like these.

Alison Baines: a girl with many descriptions. The procrastinator who never turned in a complete homework assignment. The archetypal literature club president. The antsy daughter that never came out of the house on weekends, who was often neglected by her parents.

She had one good friend—Gabe Espinoza, the more outgoing one of the two. Gabe was often invited to attend social events with the more unruffled students of Grenada Heights High School, which made Alison writhe with jealousy. The pair usually hung around in the living room (when Alison wasn’t mad at him), feeding themselves with baked goods and Russian literature.

She contemplated the silly little crusades of Raskolnikov and Myshkin as the notion of hosting another reading session with Gabe rolled into her mind. Perhaps she could invite him over to binge War and Peace for a couple hours.

Her rumination was interrupted by the unpleasant cacophony of arguing between Mr. and Mrs. Baines. Alison slowly brought her earbuds out of her ears, trying to make out what they were quarreling over.

“You just sit there watching football all day on your day off, huh? I’m sick of you, for looking so fat and so fucking square all day!”

“If you got a job, maybe things would—”

“I'm a freelancer, James!”

“Then get the hell out already!”

Alison Baines clenched her jaw and put her earbuds back in, wishing she never even bothered to listen. Her mind was once again flooded with music. She closed her eyes once more, failing to notice her door creaking open.

"Alison~," Mrs. Baines sang, her pallid teeth illuminating the dim bedroom. Alison jerked her earbuds out and cursed under her breath as her mother waltzed into her chambers. "Is dinner ready?" She asked, watching her mother’s erratic gaze dart around the room. It then came to Alison that it was not a great time for visitors. "I hope you aren't hiding anything," her mother crooned, tearing her dresser open.

Alison pursed her lips together and said nothing as her mom rummaged through her belongings and tossed pieces of clothing onto the carpet.

"I'm planning on inviting Jessica over for dinner—like, tonight." Mom put down the I ❤ NY sweatshirt she held to meet Alison's gaze, who decided she was no longer in the mood for visitors. “No.”

Her mother frowned. "Come on, Al," she urged, grabbing Alison’s shoulder, "you can play the piano for her. She's a music teacher!" Alison let out a quivering breath, trembling at the thought of reciting Bach under a pair of judgemental eyes. “No.”

Mrs. Baines opened her mouth to argue but was interrupted by the kitchen timer going off. "I'll be back!" She smiled as she whisked herself out of the bedroom. The door was left ajar.

Alison sighed as she got up out of her chair to close it, taking note of the muffled squeals of utter, unadulterated joy coming from outside. She took a seat at her desk, wishing that she were once again seven years old, running around frivolously under the blazing sun.

She noticed her deft fingers begin fidgeting with the tangled frenzy of headphone wire dangling from her neck, another heavy breath escaping her lips. Alison closed her eyes and tried to think of her future, which came to her in a whirl of various images. Of her attending fan events, composing film music, painting on broad canvases, and doing all sorts of other pretentious activities.

Her lips twisted into a frown. She had no idea where she was headed in life. She knew the last thing she wanted was to end up like her father— who worked a nine-to-five job slouching in front of a computer screen, his marriage failing and his eldest daughter writhing in a depressive state.

It seemed to her that her lifeless soul was headed in the same direction. Either that, or she would die a very unfortunate death before she became an adult. 

She squeezed her eyes shut and smashed her fists against her desk, sending bits of trash into the air. Alison was going to get her life together today. She was sure of it.

That is, until she saw the state her room was in.

## Marie

"Would you call yourself a believer in fate?"

Caleb uttered a curse under his breath and dug his fingernails into his dark fists. It seemed to him that he had no control over the thoughts and questions that left his mouth, and he had drawn the query 
out of his head rather spontaneously. 

He watched as his deranged coworker, Marie, heaved a breath from the hazing cigar pleated between her fingers and gazed out the broad window they happened to sit by. She thought for a moment, the silence between them heavy and mawkish, like a hunk of ice thawing lazily over a small flame.

Marie was clinically insane. Caleb never bothered to ask about her personal life, but he knew her long enough to know she could grow slightly unhinged if there was anything bothering her. He had once witnessed his coworker hurl ornate pieces of china about her kitchen, a cacophony of angry curses and sobs making its way out of her mouth. She also managed to convince herself that she was above the law, and did whatever she wanted to those who had wronged her.

Caleb knew fully well that he did the same thing. After all, he was her coworker and loyal accomplice, but it somehow seemed worse when Marie was the one mutilating others.

After a minute of Marie thoughtfully stirring her iced water glass with her straw, an answer to Caleb’s question finally came to her lips. "No,” she answered with a sigh, pressing her fist to her cheek.

Caleb blinked. “No?” He brought the frigid glass in his palm up to his mouth and took a sip, his cup rattling with the sound of clattering ice cubes as he set it down before him. He loved receiving different replies from his prosaic questions, to be frank.

Marie pursed her thin lips together to conceal her amusement. “I believe in coincidences, but I find the concept of a ‘grand scheme of things’ to be quite ludicrous,” she went on. She threaded her rawboned fingers together and let out a laugh.

They were grabbing a bite to eat at Betty's Diner, seated in plump crimson seats by a small window. In front of them lay a mound of salt packets and a dispersed clutter of plastic menu leaflets. One of the best dining experiences in Los Angeles, according to Marie. The usual clattering of forks and dissonances of others’ conversations were not heard tonight. It seemed the two of them had the entire diner to themselves and their prosaic conversations.

A waitress strode over to their table, her mahogany dress and blonde curls flouncing with each step she took. Her cheeks were painted heavily with a pink blush, and her dress looked as if it were a couple sizes too small. That, or perhaps she just happened to have a terrible evening. She won Marie's interest nonetheless.

"Hi, what can I get for you two today?" She asked. Her shrilling voice was sickeningly high-pitched. It reminded Marie of the cacophonous workings of a recently-waxed paper shredder. She found herself wishing she could toss the waitress inside one. “You know what? I’ll order just what I had last night!”

The waitress laughed, exposing her pink gums, glinting under the diner’s hazy glow. "And what would that be, miss?" Marie shot her a look. It was in her nature to make others feel uncomfortable. "I only go here, like, every day," she taunted, glancing over at Caleb, whose lips were pursed. The blonde let out another sheepish laugh.

"Just get her the French Dip and a strawberry shake," Caleb grumbled, burying his face in his palms before Marie could go any further. Nodding, the waitress tried her best to smile and stiffly moved herself back into the kitchen.

Marie stamped her cigarette out on the checkered tablecloth, gazing out the window and into the moonlit parking lot outside. There were no stars tonight. In fact, there were no stars yesterday, and the night before.

She frowned. The skies looked so barren without its stars, she thought to herself.

“The sky’s weird,” she took a sip from her glass. “I guess all the probes floating around in space..." her voice trailed off as she felt her toe nudge at a lanky object beneath the table. After she glanced down, she noticed a large briefcase laying silently at their feet.

Caleb’s gaze slowly drifted downward, making its way under the dining table. The pair exchanged dumbfounded looks. Was it… the briefcase? Marie felt her lips twist into a cold smile: obtaining it was far easier than they thought.

"Sad, ain't it?" Caleb mumbled, his arm slowly extending under the table. Marie watched as he wrapped his fingers around its grip and set it on the table, atop a frenzy of salt packets and menu leaflets. It wore a metal badge, engraved with the name “Kenzo”. Marie felt her grin only grow wider. "Thank you, Caleb." The thing weighed only about ten pounds, according to her scrutiny. It was lighter than they had anticipated. But nonetheless, a briefcase was a briefcase.

“A forgetful someone must have left it here,” Marie giggled, running her fingers along its leather brim. It was the briefcase they’d fought tooth and nail to get a hold of, and here they were: undoing its latches at Betty’s Diner. Naturally, Marie’s fingers nearly broke its clasp trying to tear it open.

It took a moment for her incisive eyes to settle on its contents.

“What's inside?” Caleb insisted, eagerly bringing himself to the edge of his seat. He watched the corners of Marie’s lips falter. She looked down at the case, then back at Caleb, her words failing.

He frowned. “Tell me what’s inside the box, Marie.”

Her fists met the tablecloth with fury. “It’s empty. Kenny’s briefcase is empty,” she muttered through gritted teeth. Caleb didn’t look surprised. “I knew he was bluffing from the start,” he said with a sigh. Marie chuckled, sealing the case and placing it in the seat beside her. Her night was officially ruined.

She looked up at Caleb and forced a smile, resting her chin on her intertwined hands. He could only smile back.

???

I opened my eyes to find myself hovering six feet off the streets of Los Angeles.
	
After a couple seconds, it came to me that I was not suspended in midair, but standing in a glass elevator, slowly ascending into the heavens. I looked down through the transparent platform and watched as civilians shuffled down the street, as if they didn't notice the spectacle of an odd-looking man being lifted into the sky. Could they even see me?

I felt my heart pound. Where was I going, anyway? I looked up, and saw nothing but ether.
	
A woman was standing beside me. "Hi," I mumbled. She was pretty, I thought. Sweeps of dark hair fell to her shoulders, and her eyes were the shade of strong coffee. But something about her seemed... off. I came to the conclusion that we were very different people.
	
"What brings you here?" The woman asked, perhaps in an attempt to strike a conversation. I blinked. I was dead, I remembered. But why? I felt her heavy gaze scrutinize me as I dug through my thoughts for an answer. "You look familiar," I managed to sputter. The low whirring sound of the elevator's working gears occupied the chamber.

She made a face after a minute of profound silence, digging her gloved hands into the pockets of her coat. "Tell me your name."

It was amusing, how I'd recalled it in an instant. "Gabriel," I answered, a strange sensation washing over me.
	
She narrowed her eyes. "I don't know you... but I'm gonna follow you up there," the woman sighed. Up where? She gestured upwards. I wrinkled my nose and looked up, but saw nothing other than a plod of chalky clouds. "Okay," I nodded.

I decided to look below, and saw the bustling citizens of Los Angeles grow smaller by the second. It was as 
	
The two of us were suddenly ascending into a thick mass of cloud. We must be getting close, I hoped. I stared blankly at the beads of precipitation trailing down the elevator's glass panes.

It was quiet. I silently hoped neither of us would breathe a word to each other until we made it out of the elevator.
	
"Your birth year," She demanded, suddenly.

"My what?"

"Tell me the year you were born," she sniffed. I furrowed my brows together, a number finally popping into my head after a couple minutes of thought. "Nineteen-ninety-nine. I can't remember anything else, so-"
	
"Yeah, okay, no shit," she sneered. "Man, you really don't get tired of standing, do you?" She took a seat down on the cold glass floor. We were only standing for a couple of minutes, but I sat down as well, my limbs cracking and popping as they bent. She observed, glaring at me almost pitifully.

It was a dry Saturday morning, before the sun's body began its ascent into the deep-purple dawn. River Wombacher's head hung over the marble counter of the jazz bar he owned and operated, his brows furrowed in contemplation. Slightly drunk and rather haphazardly, he read the headlines printed on the television screen in front of him. Chicago's newscast services had been displaying the same headlines for weeks. Another school shooting at a chummy high school in the suburbs, another senator caught having an affair.

The bright jazz harmony buzzing steadily in the background brought forth a perfectly-timed ritardando, slowing to a halt. His left arm stroked his chin as his other brought the dreamy, slow-burning tip of his cigar to his lips. He closed his eyes, trying to think of a time before everything went terribly wrong, before the thought of opening a bar had even entered his mind, before he started keeping track of his graying hairs. He had a dream, once, he recalled. So, then, what happened?

"River?"

He turned his head slightly, clearly in a daze, yet still acknowledging that someone was asking for him.

"River Wombacher?"

River swallowed and wheeled his chair around, letting out a long breath. It was only when he studied the person before him when he pressed the burning tip of his cigar to his ash tray, lips pursing. He studied him for good measure. The sloppy way he tied his tie, the green, lake-colored eyes, the wads of light-brown hair that had been left to grow out over the years.

"Have a seat, Travis," he sighed, gesturing for the leather stool beside his. Travis pulled it out from beneath and sat, clearing the train of his coat from beneath and setting his gray messenger bag on his lap. The sight of it struck a chord of nostalgia within River, who looked away almost instantly.

"I own this place," he blurted out, slightly drunk. He watched Travis bite back a smile. "Oh. Fantastic."

"What're you doing here in Chicago?"

"We're on a family vacation. Had a quarrel with my wife earlier. Just here to cool off."

"Jesus. Fate and its little schemes."

Travis let out a laugh, taking a sip from the glass a bartender just set on the counter. He watched River nervously run his hands through his hair and fumble with discomfort. Something was on his mind, and he had an idea of what it was.

The question was like a marble in River's throat. He opened his mouth to speak, but Travis beat him to it.

"It's funny how a talent like you ended up here."

River didn't know how to reply to that.

"Those musicians over there sound great, don't they?" Travis looked over his shoulder to get a look at the well-dressed musicians plucking harmoniously at strings and blowing into intricate brass pipes. His eyes locked with the soloist, a skinny, long-fingered man hammering the piano in front of him.

"You always hated jazz," Travis frowned, emptying his glass, giving River a slight headache. He leaned into River, smiling and setting his large hand on River's shoulder. "Listen, you sounded twice as good as that motherfucker up there. Consider re-joining Weber Conservatory."

"I don't need Weber. I never needed Weber, Travis."

Travis chuckled. "Well, Weber needed you."

River flinched, taken aback by his words, which were clearly lies. The school of music had perhaps needed his skill, but they never wanted River himself. Thinking of this, he closed his eyes.

"I needed Weber...once."

Suddenly River was back in New York, the city that never slept. He was rounding a filthy street corner and stumbling into a velvet-carpeted hallway which smelled of grease and polished wood. He sprinted down the hallway, his breath dying in his chest. He could hear Rachmaninoff's third piano concerto being rehearsed in the background, except it was only an orchestra, without the solo part. It sounded unrecognizable to the real thing as a result.

There was a woman standing at the door. He could recognize her faintly as one of the members of the orchestra, perhaps a clarinet or horn player. She was wearing a white blouse and a burgundy pencil skirt, bringing out the suppleness of her waist. She stood placidly at the door. *Flautist.*

"Late to rehearsal?" She had a sleepy, raspy voice.

"Please. I'm the soloist."

She let out a laugh, a dainty thing. "Lucky me," she smiled sarcastically, playing with the smooth silver bracelet on her wrist. "If I were you, I'd shoot Mitchell a text telling him you can't make it and leave."

River wanted to kill her. "The concert's tonight. We've only had, say, two rehearsals. If you'd let me through---"

"If you insist," she scowled, opening the door, the airy sounds of the orchestra growing louder.

The conductor, Dr. Mitchell, a skinny, bearded man, snapped his fists shut, taking the orchestra by surprise. "Look who's here, everyone. Our soloist!" River couldn't tell whether it was Dr. Mitchell's fat, sickening German accent or his growing migraine that was making him consider canceling his concert.

River felt his face turn a hideous shade of magenta as he approached the piano, its scratched black surface glimmering beneath the artificial studio lights. He sat on the dusty leather bench before him, feeling the weighty gazes of ninety-eight musicians over his shoulders. He hated it here.

His gaze caught onto the girl from earlier, the flutist. She was clearly the best in her section, as she was seated in front. Yet she blended in so well with the other skinny, empty-headed female flutists. She was pale and had big, droopy eyes. You could see the bones peeping out from beneath her skin.

"First movement, from the beginning," bellowed the conductor. "*One*, two, three, *four*, five, six, *seven*, eight, nine."

River had never performed the opening of the piece with an orchestra before. It began with the sharp blaring of horns, bleeding into the technical piano part, which seemed to be heavy with this strange, piercing drama. And then all of a sudden, the dread he had felt earlier eased away into particles.

Performing had its way of ridding the discomfort of everything. The thoughts of being potentially homeless disappeared.

After running through the first movement, he realized he felt wonderful. It was his first time being a soloist. He was used to accompanying the other parts. He was used to being ignored. But a couple words from Dr. Mitchell's greasy mouth wiped his faint smile from existence.

"That was the worst Rachmaninoff I've ever heard."

And River suddenly found himself wishing he was an accompanist again.

"Don't listen to Mitchell. You sounded wonderful," went Travis, River's only friend. He was the type of man whose beauty carried itself to every corner of the room. He was applying some sort of wax onto the corked portions of his clarinet.

They were taking a break, eating the burritos the faculty gave out for free on the stage seats as a jazz group performed whatever they were working on onstage.

"I'm thinking of strangling whoever invented jazz," River sighed, reclining in his seat. Travis let out a sneer. "Who knows. If we don't make it, we might end up as one of them."

River laughed. Then the dread of impending doom washed over him, and so he stood up, weary. His gaze wavered over to his silver watch, which really wasn't silver, but he really liked to believe it was. It read 5:00, precisely. The concert was in three hours. "I need to head to a practice room," he sighed, flinging his canvas bag over his shoulder and pacing towards the hallway leading out.

And soon, it was time to perform River's debut concert, the one scoring the start of his career as a soloist. It had been long since he had performed by the foyer in his teacher's apartment, entertaining guests whenever he bothered to throw a party.

River was wearing standard black trousers and a standard white shirt, with a standard black tie to match. He didn't mess with his hair, which already seemed to be tame and slicked back.

It was six-thirty when he strode onstage with a bow, swallowing his nervousness as he caught sight of the way his reflection gleamed on the polished wood.

*"That was the worst Rachmaninoff I've ever heard."*

River pictured Dr. Mitchell's bony, oily face. He was lying to him. Back then, he had become the music itself, rewritten what had been on the score. River thought he did well. All he had to do was prove it to the audience.

When the piece opened with the sharp blaring of horns, the audience's presence no longer bothered River. He was now playing music and he had no other purpose but to perform.

The concert went by quickly, River occasionally blinking back into reality, taking glances at the hundreds of audience members viewing his performance. During a slow passage in the piece's second movement, his gaze wavered over to the flutist.

He watched her slender fingers nimbly graze her flute's gilded keys, releasing graceful sounds which blanketed the sharp noises coming from the piano. That was the job of the orchestra.

"You did wonderful last night," went Dr. Mitchell, shuffling in his stance. River did not reply, only pursing his lips together.

The air was frigid. The red sun was beginning to boil into the

"I was lying," he sighed. "I was lying about your performance being awful the other day. It really swept my off my feet."

River did not know what to say. If anything, he hated Dr. Mitchell. He hated having to perform before hundreds of judgemental gazes. He hated the flautist he met earlier and perhaps even himself, too.

And so, River scowled, and pushed past Dr. Mitchell as he made his way back into the facility, the cold air whipping his hair back.

The jazz bar had grown humid. River moved his tongue over his mouth ulcer as he turned to face Travis, his face grown dull with age. Travis was taking breaths from his cigar, perhaps reminiscing as well.

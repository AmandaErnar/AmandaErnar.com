<article><h1>Jasmine</h1>
  <p>Written: 2/28/23</p>
  <p>“It’s always cruel, when someone you love becomes not but a memory,” whispers the skinny, gray-haired woman sitting by me. She’s talking to her husband, male friend, something of the sort. I’m blearily picking up fragments of their conversation. She’s wearing an expensive, ruddy cocktail dress, I notice, reminding myself of my burning hatred for jazz.</p>
<p>I happen to own the jazz bar we’re in, situated in the dead of Chicago, several blocks down from the pier. It isn’t well-known or anything. Sleepless and bored, I walk in at around midnight. Something new seems to transpire there each evening.</p>
<p>My head hangs over a pallid countertop as headache-inducing lights flash in the background. I realize it’s getting late, gazing sleepily out the only window in the room. There aren’t any stars tonight, just clouds. Exhaust weaving the city and the sky together.</p>
<p>The pianist up front is a skinny, long-fingered man battering the piano with his hands, his head bobbing with the inept music. The audience seems to be enjoying it. Afterward, his bow is followed by a round of eager, rattling applause.</p>
<p>My eyes shut as I try to remember a time before I joined my family in Chicago, back when I was studying to become a world-renowned piano soloist, performing the works of Scriabin and Chopin at concert halls jeweling Europe. Australia. Asia.</p>
<p>Of course, as do countless other dreams, everything fell apart.</p>
<p>I let my thoughts drift and marinate in the scenery—the queer murmuring of voices, the clinking of glasses, the obnoxious, airy trills and peeps of a clarinet.</p>
<ul><li></li></ul>
<p>Suddenly I find I’m in New York, a city that never seems to stop and catch its breath. How old am I—sixteen? Seventeen?</p>
<p>The streets are noisy as per usual. A siren wails somewhere in the distance. The dizzying structures surrounding me are snake-scale beneath the dying sunlight. The sky bleeds a deep violet, the color of a bruise. Strangers don’t seem to take much notice as I shove past. My designer shoes beat against the greasy streets and my necktie flails behind me as I run. I’m leaving my grief counseling session in a hurry, realizing I have to rehearse for an upcoming performance.</p>
<p>I round a filthy street corner and stumble into a hallway saturated with an odd, expensive scent. There are no photographs or adornments on the walls. Weber Conservatory, reads the letters painted on the textured walls in an ugly bubble font. It’s six in the evening, and I haven’t eaten since yesterday. My stomach burns.</p>
<p>I can hear Beethoven’s <em>Archduke</em> murmuring behind the doors ahead, though it sounds funny; the pianist happens to be a little behind schedule.</p>
<p>A girl stands at the auditorium doors, checking the time on her watch. She’s wearing plain, expensive clothing, like a kid dressing to impress the grown-ups. Her fingernails are unkempt from biting. Her makeup looks like it’s been done by a child. Though she’s tall and pale, her loveliness drifting to the other end of the hall. She lifts her chin to face me, beaming. </p>
<p>“Late for rehearsal?” She has a sleepy, raspy voice.</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, so if you could—”</p>
<p>“We should leave.”</p>
<p>There seems to be something wrong with her. “What’re you talking about? I can’t just leave.”</p>
<p>“And we were both thinking of shooting the other guy a text and leaving just now. He probably already thinks we aren’t coming.”</p>
<p>I think about the consequences of leaving for a moment.</p>
<ul><li></li></ul>
<p>We half-wittedly leave the building and have a cab take us to the beach. I don’t know why I listen. “Fire Island,” she says to the driver.</p>
<p>When we arrive, there seems to be nothing but us and the cold, empty night, our exposed skin burning with the dry tang of the Atlantic air. The lamplights set our faces aglow with scarlet and turn my smile a quaint, porcelain shade of amber.</p>
<p>We sit down, laughing under our breaths for no reason. We speak about our lives before Weber, embarrassing moments from our childhood, staring into the sky—a creamy cobalt. The ocean lurks ahead, various artificial lights misting its waters, its waves smashing against the searocks.</p>
<p>My hand gathers a fistful of sand. “Would you call yourself a believer in fate?” She asks. Her voice buzzes and repeats in my head, making the stars blink and buildings behind us tremble. I close my eyes, trying to think of an answer.</p>
<p>“No, not really,” I reply. “I believe in coincidences, though.”</p>
<p>She tilts her head to the side, grinning. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>There’s something strange about her, as haunting as she already is. I remind myself I don’t even know her name. “Tell me your name first,” I swallow, watching her features shift beneath the lights. It’s like she’s a mirage, a memory.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Jasmine. “Funny. I used to know someone with that name,” I remember. “Well, I just don’t think it’s right to assume everything’s been preordained by god or something. It makes life a lot more bearable, to think that it’s all spontaneous and doesn’t happen for some sick reason.” A sheepish smile creeps across my face. “I don’t know. What about you?”</p>
<p>I don’t get a response.</p>
<p>The night feels a little emptier. I relax my hand, and the sand from within comes spilling out. Perhaps I shouldn’t have left that counseling session on such short notice, I think with a sigh. I can’t help but wonder what could have been if Jasmine were really sitting beside me, laughing at the constellations spinning with contempt above our heads.</p>
<ul><li></li></ul>
<p>My eyes close, and I can hear us performing Beethoven’s <em>Archduke</em>. It’s almost mournful behind its grinning chords. It sings of something strange. Of joy before the gloom of realization.
The cool studio lights wane and quiver atop the piano’s scratched black surface. My fingers dance over the keys, slowing and quickening at the glances of the others. I look over my shoulder and smile at her. Jasmine smiles back.</p></article></main>

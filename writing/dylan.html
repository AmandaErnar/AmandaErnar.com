<article><h1>Dylan</h1>
  <p>Written: 2/4/2022</p>
  <p>The day was nearing its end. He watched as the sun’s scarlet rays brushed over the boundless pasture and blanketed the sky, glancing up at the fleeting scarlet above, which was dappled with stars and splashed with various blushing hues, inhaling the sweet scent of wild honeysuckles and white lilies. He came to visit this relatively well-formed part of town every other week, when given the time. “Beautiful day,” he grumbled to himself, pulling in a breath from his hazing cigar. He glanced at his watch and mumbled a curse, for it was almost four, and he had to be back at camp by then.</p>
<p>Dylan was only sixteen, which further proved how desperate the nation was for men. And women.</p>
<p>It had been several years since he began fighting in the fifty years’ war, and those years had felt like an eternity to Dylan. He had spent his first hundred nights as a soldier counting the stars and reminiscing about his life before the draft. He had something to live for back then: his past, which now seemed vague and was slowly chipping away from his memory.</p>
<p>Dylan used the spare time he had to smoke. Out in the wilderness, somewhere far and distant from whichever fort the others were occupying, in case a brushfire was to start.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, it seemed everyone’s deaths were petty and absurd. They died like dazed bugs being crushed under someone’s foot, as they were quickly shot to death, without a chance to even think. Dylan knew the battle scene all too well. He pressed his cigar into his lips, watching the distant sparks of soldiers’ hazing campfires from afar.</p>
<p>It was as if everyone’s livelihoods and deaths were mere leaves floating down a vast river. But where would that river lead? Would it lead to them winning the war?</p>
<p>“Finally found you, birthday boy.” Dylan looked up to see the cheery face of his friend, Chris, hovering above him. Dylan’s features tensed. Right, August happened to be coming to an end. Yet, partying with everyone else seemed to be among the last things he wanted to do. The others were probably drunk and woozy. Dylan knew they were celebrating the successful capture of Fort Winde after an embarrassing three months’ siege. “C’mon, Ree, it’s not like that Alis Hovey’s gonna eat you,” Chris jeered.</p>
<p>Dylan pressed his lips together. A few campfire stories and a couple of drinks wouldn’t hurt, he supposed. Sighing, he stood and brushed himself off, leaving an imprint in the patch of the tall grain beneath him, and tossed his dead cig aside.</p>
<p>Chris led him down a rugged flagstone path that led the pair down to Fort Winde, which was crowded to death with people. Everywhere Dylan looked, soldiers gambled, wrestled, and laughed in a ditzy haze of drunk lunacy. “I’ll be right back!” Chris leered, gesturing a small apology and walking off. Dylan sat down on a plump duffel bag and poured himself a glass of rye. He hated this place. He glanced around, trying to spot Chris somewhere amidst the mass of people before him, but that idiot was nowhere to be found. All the commotion must have sent him rushing off in a whirl of affable remarks and vivacious flattery. Dylan cringed.</p>
<p>A group of officials sat down next to him. “There’s this woman back in West Eden,” one began, drumming his fingers on the rim of his glass, “she’s into reading old, musty, coffee-stained <em>books</em> that aren’t even good. Real pretty, though.” He took a generous sip from his glass and drew a box of cigars from his back pocket while the others started to murmur amongst themselves about their own, equally-miserable lives. Dylan pretended not to notice. The man who sat beside him cleared his throat and leaned back in his seat. “Like hell I’ll live to see the end of this war,” he sneered. He glanced over his shoulder anxiously. Dylan found himself hoping no one heard him.</p>
<p>“And what would your name be, kid?” A man who appeared to belong to their circle asked, biting down on the tip of his cigar. Dylan looked up at him and laughed.</p>
<p>“Don’t got one, sir.” He grinned sheepishly. The man pulled a breath from his cigar and exhaled deeply. “Sure you do. What do the others call you?” He pressed on. </p>
<p>“They call me Dylan,” he shrugged. “Mind lending me one of those?”</p></article></main>

Writers, we can all agree that it's hard to keep writing. It's hard to go on without going back to edit. If you ask the best writer how they cope with this, there's a chance they'll tell you their secret: something called *writing out loud*. Have a conversation with yourself in your head. Let your fingers dance across the plastic keys of your Corsair keyboard and have the words flow from your mind. It will feel as if there is a string weaving your thoughts and your fingers together. Seconds will bleed into minutes as you use this technique. Soon enough, you'll have almost a thousand words written, which you'll go back through and edit all at once. This, my friends, is the most efficient way to write.

Ever skimmed over a swathe of text, your mind subconsciously giving definitions to the plethora of words you don't know? This has happened to all of us at least once before. It's hard for a piece of writing to sink in and truly connect with your reader if they don't understand what it means to begin with. I've seen writers think they're smart when they use big words, wacky jargons, and average ten words per sentence when their readers don't understand anything.

Keep things simple.

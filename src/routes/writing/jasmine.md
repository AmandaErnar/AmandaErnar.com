“You ruined everything,” I murmured, reminding myself I hated jazz.

My head hung over the marble counter of the jazz bar I owned and operated as I stroked my chin in contemplation, using my other hand to bring my cigar’s smoldering tip to my lips. It was quite late, right before the sun bloomed into dawn. I walked in earlier that night in hopes of curing my boredom. There was always something new that happened there each time I went.

My heavy-lidded eyes grazed the garish headlines on the television up front. I’d hoped for good news, but Chicago would always be Chicago. Another fight at an underfunded suburban high school, another official caught having an affair.

The liberal jazz harmony buzzing in the background slowed to a halt. I locked eyes with the pianist, a long-fingered man battering the piano with his hands. His bow was followed by a round of tame, pitter-pattering applause.

My eyes shut on their own as I tried to remember a time before I decided to join my family in Chicago, before opening this ridiculous cabaret, back when my heart fizzed and bustled at the idea of becoming a pianist. Yet you would have to be somewhat delusional to chase a dream of that capacity, especially after losing a loved one.

I allowed my thoughts to drift and marinate in the grotesque scenery—the clashing of voices, the clinking of wine glasses, the trills and peeps of a clarinet player warming up.


Suddenly I was back in New York, a city that never seemed to stop and catch its breath. How old was I, sixteen? Seventeen?

The streets were noisy as per usual and the sky bled a dark fuschia. My breath caught in my throat as my expensive shoes beat against the grimy, oily streets, my black tie and knapsack flailing behind me. Prosily dressed strangers didn’t bat an eye at me as I shoved past. A police siren wailed somewhere in the distance.

I rounded a filthy street corner and stumbled into a carpeted hallway saturated with a strange woody scent. The hour was late and I had not eaten since that morning. I hadn’t even taken my medications that day.

I had left my counseling session with Dr. Tafeen in a hurry, realizing that I had to rehearse for the following week’s performance. If I didn’t make it, terrible things would happen.

Weber Conservatory, read the colorful letters painted on the textured walls in an ugly bubble font.

The breath slowly died in my chest as I ran down the hall. I could hear Beethoven’s Archduke murmuring faintly behind the doors ahead, though it was far from what it was supposed to sound like; the pianist happened to be a little behind schedule.

A girl stood at the auditorium door. Her skin was pale, almost lavender. She wore a blouse and a maroon pencil skirt as if she had just wrapped up some sort of prosaic business meeting. Though she seemed too young for that. Somehow, it was all familiar—there was something about her that struck a chord of nostalgia in me, though I failed to put my finger on what it was.

“Late for rehearsal?” She had a sleepy, raspy voice.

“Well, I happen to be the pianist, so if you could—”

She laughed, her thumb lingering on the smooth silver bracelet on her wrist. I felt as if I had seen her before. Who was she, exactly? Perhaps she was a member of the orchestra. Yet she held no instrument in her hands.

“We should ditch,” she said, breaking the silence.

It was my turn to laugh. “I’m the Archduke’s soloist,” I repeated.

“And we were both thinking of shooting the others a ‘can’t make it’ text and leaving just now.”

I chuckled, shaking my head. “You’re right.”

We half-wittedly decided to leave the building and have a cab take us to the beach. The cab driver shot us curious glances as we spoke.

Then it was just us and the cold, empty night, our exposed skin burning with the dry tang of the Atlantic air. The lamplights lit our faces a burning scarlet and turned my smile a cold shade of amber.

We sat down on the gray sand, laughing under our breaths for no reason. For a while, we spoke about our lives before Weber, embarrassing moments from our childhood, staring into the sky—a creamy cobalt. The ocean lurked below, various artificial lights misting its waters, its waves crashing against the black rocks freckling the shore.

“Would you call yourself a believer in fate?”

I closed my eyes, immersing myself in the terse sounds and noises around me, trying to sift through my thoughts for an answer.

“No, not really,” I finally replied. “I believe in coincidences, though.” My hand absently gathered a fistful of sand.

She tilted her head playfully to the side, almost grinning. “What do you mean?” There was something off about her, as haunting as she already was. And perhaps there was something sinister going on; I barely knew who she was. I didn't even know her name.

“Tell me your name first,” I said, swallowing, watching her features move and dance under the enveloping lights. She smiled. “Jasmine.”

Jasmine watched my gaze shift. “Funny. I used to know someone with that name,” I said, looking away from her. “I find the idea of a whole grand scheme of things to be quite ludicrous. I mean—what, you’re just going to assume everything has been preordained by the hand of god or something?”

I smiled sheepishly. “I don’t know. I’m not one of those spiritual people. Are you?”

When I looked back at her, Jasmine was gone. It was like she was never there. Like she had been merely a figure of my imagination. I relaxed my hand, and the sand that had gathered inside eased its way through my fingers, falling to the seemingly endless sea of grain beneath.

My chest sank.

I remember wondering what Dr. Tafeen would have said at the fact that I had let her take me all the way there.

I always hated jazz.

It was early, before the sun even began its ascent into dawn. My head hung over the marble counter of the jazz bar I owned and operated as I stroked my chin in contemplation, using my other hand to bring my cigar's dreamy, smoldering tip to my lips.

My eyes grazed the garish headlines displayed on the television up front as my tongue aggravatingly circled the tender gash lining roof of my mouth. I had hoped for good news, but Chicago would always be Chicago. Another fight at an underfunded suburban high school,  another official caught having an affair.

The bright jazz harmony buzzing in the background slowed to a halt in a poorly timed ritardando. I locked eyes with the pianist, a long-fingered man hammering the piano with his hands. His playing sounded somewhat furious.

I shut my eyes and tried to remember a time before all this. Before I decided to join my family in Chicago, before opening this ridiculous jazz bar. Back when my heart fizzed and bustled at the idea of stealing the hearts of America with my music. Of capturing breaths and saving lives. But you would have to grow somewhat delusional chasing a dream of that capacity, especially when things had been…happening.

Suddenly I was back in New York, the city that never slept. How old was I, sixteen? Seventeen?

I was rounding a filthy street corner and stumbling out of a velvet-carpeted hallway saturated with a strange woody scent. The hour was late, and I had not eaten since that morning. I had not even taken my medications that day.

Weber Conservatory, read the colorful letters painted on the textured walls in an ugly bubble font.

The breath died in my chest as I sprinted down the hall. I could hear Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 1 playing in the background, though it was far from what it was supposed to sound like; the soloist happened to be a little behind schedule.

A girl stood at the auditorium door. She wore a white blouse and a maroon skirt as if she had just stumbled out of a business meeting. Though she seemed too young for that. Her skin was pale, almost lavender. There was something about her that struck a chord of nostalgia in me, though I failed to put my finger on what it was.

"Late for rehearsal?" She had a sleepy, raspy voice.

"Please, I'm the soloist."

She laughed, her hand lingering on the smooth silver bracelet on her wrist. I felt as if I had seen her before. Who was she, exactly? Perhaps she was only a member of the orchestra. Yet she held no instrument in her hands.

"We should ditch," she said, breaking the silence. Was she a member of the orchestra?

It was my turn to laugh. "I'm the soloist," I repeated.

"And we were both thinking of shooting Mitchell a 'can't make it' text and leaving just now."

I chuckled, shaking my head. "You're right."

We spontaneously decided to leave the building and had a cab take us to the beach. The cab driver shot us curious glances as we spoke. "Fire Island," she had said to him.

Then it was just us and the cold, empty night, our exposed skin burning with the dry bite of the Atlantic air. The lamplights lit our faces a burning scarlet and turned my smile a cold, porcelain shade of amber.

We sat down on the gray sand, laughing under our breaths for no reason. For a while, we just talked about our lives before Weber, embarrassing moments from our childhood, gazing dreamily into the sky—a creamy cobalt. The ocean lurked below, various artificial lights misting its crisp waters, its waves crashing against the black searocks. I closed my eyes, immersing myself in the terse sounds and noises around me, trying to sift through my thoughts for an answer.

“No, not really,” I finally replied. “I believe in coincidences, though.” My hand absently grabbed a fistful of sand.

She tilted her head playfully to the side, almost grinning. “What do you mean?” There was something off about her, as haunting as she already was. And maybe there was something sinister about the fact that she wanted an answer to the question when I barely knew who she was. I did not even know her name.

"Tell me your name first," I said, swallowing, watching her features move and dance under the enveloping lights. She smiled. "Jasmine."

Jasmine watched my gaze shift. "Funny. I used to know someone with that name," I said, looking away from her. I started thinking about the repercussions of leaving rehearsal without telling anyone.

I drew in a deep breath. "I find the idea of a whole grand scheme of things to be quite ludicrous. I mean—what, you’re just going to assume everything has been preordained by the hand of god or something?”

“But what if there actually was such a thing? What if every single breath I’ve ever taken, the fact that the universe is a thing to begin with, has led to us leaving rehearsal? There’s got to be a bunch of factors leading up to every event ever.”

I swallowed. “I don’t know. I'm not one of those spiritual people."

When I looked back at her, Jasmine was gone. It was like she was never there. Like she had been merely a figure of my imagination. I relaxed my hand, and the sand that had gathered inside eased its way through my fingers, falling to the seemingly endless sea of grain beneath.

My chest sank.

I remember wondering what my therapist would have said at the fact that I had let her take me all the way there.

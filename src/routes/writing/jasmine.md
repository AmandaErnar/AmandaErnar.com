I’ve always hated jazz.

I own a jazz bar in the dead of Chicago, several blocks up from Millennium Park. It isn’t well-known or anything. Sleepless and bored, I walk in at around midnight.

My head hangs limp over one of its many pallid tabletops. I bring a warm cigar to my mouth, feeling its tip pierce my crumbling lips. It’s getting late. There are no stars tonight, only clouds. Exhaust weaving the city and the sky together.

The pianist tonight is a skinny, long-fingered man battering the piano with his hands, his head bobbing with the ill-timed music. The audience seems to be enjoying it. Afterward, his bow is followed by a round of eager, rattling applause. He doesn’t even look at me. 

My eyes shut as I try to remember a time before I joined my family in Chicago. Before opening this ridiculous cabaret, when I was studying to become a pianist, up there with Horowitz and Rubinstein. I had dedicated my entire childhood to the hobby.

Of course, as did countless other dreams, it fell apart.

My thoughts drift and marinate in the scenery—the queer murmuring of voices, the clinking of glasses, the trills and peeps of a clarinet player warming up.

Suddenly I find I’m in New York, a city that never seems to stop and catch its breath. How old am I—sixteen? Seventeen?

The silver structures I’m surrounded by are snake-scale under the sinking sun. The streets are noisier than usual, and the sky bleeds a deep violet. My designer shoes are beating against the grimy, oily streets, my black tie flailing behind me. Strangers don’t waver as I shove past. A siren wails somewhere in the distance.

I realize I haven’t taken my medications yet. I’m leaving my grief counseling session in a hurry, realizing that I was about to miss rehearsal for the following week’s performance.

I round a filthy street corner and stumble into a hallway saturated with the heavy scent of sandalwood. There are no photographs or adornments on the walls. Weber Conservatory, reads the letters painted on the textured walls in an ugly bubble font.

It’s six in the evening, and I haven’t eaten since yesterday. My stomach burns. I can hear Beethoven’s Archduke murmuring behind the doors ahead, though it sounds funny; the pianist isn’t there and is a little behind schedule.

A girl stands at the doors, checking the time on her watch. She’s wearing plain, expensive clothing, like a child dressing to impress the grown-ups. Her fingernails are unkempt from biting. Her socks don’t match. She’s tall and pale, her loveliness drifting to the other end of the hall.

“Late for rehearsal?” She has a sleepy, raspy voice.

“Well, yes, so if you could—”

She laughs, her thumb lingering on her silver bracelet. “We should ditch.”

It’s my turn to laugh. “I can’t miss this.”

“And we were both thinking of shooting the others a ‘can’t make it’ text and leaving just now. They probably already think we aren’t coming.”

I think about the consequences of leaving for a moment.

We half-wittedly leave the building and have a cab take us to the beach. I don’t know why I listen. “Fire Island,” she says to the driver.

When we get there, there seems to be nothing but us and the cold, empty night, our exposed skin burning with the dry tang of the Atlantic air. The lamplights set us aglow with scarlet and turn my smile a frigid, porcelain shade of amber.

We sit ourselves down on the gray sand, laughing under our breaths for no reason. For a while, we speak about our lives before Weber, embarrassing moments from our childhood, staring into the sky—a creamy cobalt. The ocean lurks ahead, various artificial lights misting its waters, its waves smashing against the black rocks tracing the shoreline.

My hand gathers a fistful of sand. “Would you call yourself a believer in fate?” She asks. Her voice hums and repeats in my head, making the stars blink and buildings behind us tremble. I close my eyes and try to think of an answer.

“No not really,” I reply. “I believe in coincidences, though.”

She tilts her head to the side, grinning. “What do you mean?”

There’s something strange about her, as haunting as she already is. I remind myself I don’t even know her name.

“Tell me your name first,” I swallow, watching her features shift beneath the lights. She lets out a soft laugh. “Alison.”

Alison. “Funny. I used to know someone with that name,” I remember. Then it hits me that I have been here before.

“Well, I just don’t think it’s right to assume everything’s been preordained by the hand of god. It’s the twenty-first century, for god’s sake. I thought we’d moved past that stuff.” A sheepish smile creeps across my face. “I don’t know. What about you?”

I don’t get a response. The night feels a little emptier.

I relax my hand, and the sand within comes spilling out, falling to the sea of grain beneath.

My eyes close, and I can hear us performing Beethoven’s Archduke. It’s mournful behind its dizzying, cheerful chords. It sings of something strange. Of a false, momentary joy, perhaps before realization.

I look over my shoulder as my fingers dance over the keys and smile at her.

Maybe if she were really sitting beside me then, laughing at the constellations spinning above our heads....

I always hated jazz.

I owned a jazz bar in the dead of Chicago, several blocks up from Millennium Park. It wasn’t well-known or anything. Bored and unable to sleep, I walked in at around midnight.

My head hung limp over one of its pallid countertops as I brought a warm cigar to my lips. The hour was late. The sun was already bleeding into dawn.

My heavy-lidded eyes grazed the garish headlines on the television up front. I hoped for good news, but Chicago would always be Chicago. Another fight at an underfunded high school, another official caught having an affair.

The pianist that night was a skinny, long-fingered man battering the piano with his hands, his head bobbing with the untimely music. It seemed like the audience was enjoying it. Afterward, his bow was followed by a round of ardent, rattling applause.

My eyes shut as I tried to remember a time before I joined my family in Chicago, before opening a ridiculous cabaret, back when my heart fizzed at the idea of becoming a pianist, reinventing the world of classical music. Yet you would have to be somewhat delusional to chase a dream of that capacity, especially after losing a loved one.

Of course, as did countless other dreams, it all fell apart.

I let my thoughts drift and marinate in the grotesque scenery—the queer murmuring of voices, the clinking of glasses, the trills and peeps of a clarinet player warming up.

Suddenly I was back in New York, a city that never seemed to stop and catch its breath. How old was I—sixteen? Seventeen?

The streets were noisy as per usual and the sky bled a deep violet. My dress shoes beat against the grimy, oily streets, my black tie flailing behind me. Strangers barely took notice as I shoved past. A siren wailed somewhere in the distance.

I had left my counseling session with Dr. Tafeen in a hurry, realizing I had to rehearse for the following week’s performance.

I rounded a filthy street corner and stumbled into a hallway saturated with a strange woody scent. Weber Conservatory, read the letters painted on the textured walls in an ugly bubble font. It was six in the evening and I had not eaten since the other night. My stomach burned. I hadn’t taken my medications that day.

The breath slowly died in my chest as I ran down the hall. I could hear Beethoven’s Archduke murmuring faintly behind the doors ahead, though it sounded funny; the pianist happened to be a little behind schedule.

A girl stood at the auditorium door, checking the time on her watch. She wore plain, expensive clothing, as if she were in a business meeting. But there was some sort of amusement kindling behind her fringe and heavy makeup. She was like a child dressing to impress the grownups.

Had I seen her before? There was something nostalgic about her, though I couldn’t tell what it was.

“Late for rehearsal?” She had a sleepy, raspy voice.

“Well, yes, so if you could—”

She laughed, her thumb lingering on her smooth silver bracelet. She had to be a member of the trio, perhaps the violinist. And where was her instrument? “We should ditch,” she grinned.

It was my turn to laugh. “I can’t miss this.”

“And we were both thinking of shooting the others a ‘can’t make it’ text and leaving just now. They probably already think we flaked.”

I thought about the consequences of leaving for a moment. There would always be rehearsal tomorrow, I told myself.

We decided to leave the building and have a cab take us to the beach. I don’t know why I decided to listen to her. It was like my mind was thinking on its own, adrift in some sort of haze. “Fire Island,” she had said to the driver. 

Then it was just us and the cold, empty night, our exposed skin burning with the dry tang of the Atlantic air. The lamplights lit our faces a burning scarlet and turned my smile a cold shade of amber.

We sat down on the gray sand, laughing under our breaths for no reason. For a while, we spoke about our lives before Weber, embarrassing moments from our childhood, staring into the sky—a creamy cobalt. The ocean lurked below, various artificial lights misting its waters, its waves smashing against the rocks lining the shore.

“Would you…would you call yourself a believer in fate?” She asked, her voice humming and repeating in my head.

I closed my eyes and tried to think of an answer.

“No, not really,” I finally replied. “I believe in coincidences, though.” My hand absently collected a fistful of sand.

She tilted her head playfully to the side, grinning. “What do you mean?”

There was something off about her, as haunting as she already was. And I was starting to feel suspicious; I didn't even know her name.

“Tell me your name first,” I swallowed, watching her features shift beneath the lights. She smiled. “Jasmine.”

Jasmine. “Funny. I used to know someone with that name,” I remembered, making a face and turning away. “Well, I just don’t think it’s smart to assume everything’s been preordained by the hand of god or whatever.”

I smiled sheepishly. “I don’t know. I’m not one of those spiritual people. Are you?”

When I looked back, Jasmine was gone. Then it struck me that she was never there. She had merely been a figure of my imagination. I whisked my head around, looking for her, my chest sinking.

My phone buzzed from within my pocket. My face whitened at the message I was greeted with. Looks like our cellist had already found a replacement for me.

I relaxed my hand and the sand that gathered inside fell to the seemingly endless sea of grains beneath.

I remember wondering what Dr. Tafeen would have said.

My hands

Battered, Bruised

Have been torn,

Have been used,

Have been tortured,

Have been stepped on

They have removed weeds,

They have drawn pictures,

They have turned pages,

They have served supper

There is a scar on the right side of my right hand.

There is a blister on the left side of my left palm.

My hands can write,

My hands can tie knots,

My hands can play the piano,

My hands can feel pain

Damaged, Scarred

My hands.

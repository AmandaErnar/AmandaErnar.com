It’s a quarter till five. Melon-yellow fronds of waist-high grass dance and ripple around the bench I’m currently occupying. Black mountains paint themselves into the horizon. The sky laughs, its searing colors tincturing the east. It seems to laugh with something brilliant, something larger than life.

Its dazzling, blood-gutted colors wash over the left side of my face as I realize I have the whole park to myself.

Of course, just as the thought passes my mind, I hear footsteps. I suppose it’s a woman walking over to me, the clicking of burnished leather heels clattering behind her.

The wind whispers as she comes near. Her head makes a slight tilt to the side as she approaches me, smiling. I notice she’s wearing an old black dress, the sun setting half of it ablaze. She looks like she’s stumbled out of a funeral home. Though she seems to possess a certain sweet and saintly quality that I’ve never quite seen before. And she’s familiar. Very, very familiar.

I move to make room for her and she sits down right beside me. The run-down bench we’re sitting on creaks as she drops her weight on it with a thunk. She doesn’t seem to care.

“Beautiful morning,” she says as I shrink in my seat. Her voice is full and lovely. I’m surprised; I haven’t been so taken aback by someone’s grace in a while. “It’s lovely, isn’t it?” I murmur in response. She’s something yoked from a pleasant dream, a happy memory.

I take in a breath as I watch her in silence. I take note of the way her head drops to the side whenever she smiles. It’s charming. A sweep of dark hair falls into her face. She tucks it back behind her ear. A husky breath of wind almost sends her hair and black sundress flying, if not for her reaching hands. She opens her violet handbag and her fingers carefully pull out a box of unlit cigarettes. Her smile soars.

An array of apple trees brew in the near distance, shadowed, black with the dark of dusk that’s yet to bloom into morning. Scads of kaleidoscopic light pass through their branching silhouettes. A switchblade lays limp in my open palms. I don’t know why it’s there, or how I plan to use it. For now, it only stares back, its metallic corners aglow with white wisps of sun. My hands grow heavy with its familiar presence. There’s a certain warmth I feel as it sits, cusped in the pink, tender folds of my hands.

Smoke eludes the woman’s mouth as she breathes out. “People consider it sad, but losing someone you love is a strange experience, really. It’s painful, yes, but you come out of it as a new person, almost.” She sighs as she says this, lighting herself a cigarette. I don’t know how this conversation has come about. I look up at her, flustered. “With all due respect, why are you telling me this?”

She shrugs. “Beats me.”

There’s warmth in her gaze. She exhales, the bottom half of her face hiding in bogs of gray smoke. I don’t know what to say. I think of asking for a cigarette, but the idea escapes me.

The faint and ever distant barking of a dog, the soft chill of the breeze, the earthy scents around us occupy the gaping silence.

“There was this girl,” I say, finally. “You remind me of her.”

She lets out a soft laugh. Her lips are a sweet somersault of red. “Do I?” She asks, clearly interested. Our gazes meet. She doesn’t look pleased or annoyed, simply puzzling. “So you’re saying that there *was* this girl, huh? I’ll assume that this girl you knew is *dead*.” She puts emphasis on the word *dead*.

I scoff. “You can’t be serious.”

“Is she?” She asks.

My silence speaks for itself.

She leans back in her seat, sighing. “They say grief is a medicine of its own. I don’t know, though. There are people out there who just can’t recover from loss.” She tilts her head to the side. “How long has it been since—”

“Six years.” Pictures, snapshots of us flash in my mind. I force my eyes shut; it’s painful to remember. “If you’re still grieving, then, I guess you’re helpless,” she sighs.

I open my mouth to speak. I watch as her gaze drifts over to the weapon sitting in my palms.

“The switchblade,” she begins, “you came here to take your life, didn’t you?” Her voice grows quiet. The girl lets out a sound of disappointment, making the apple leaves shiver from afar and peach-yellow clouds groan above our heads.

There’s something unearthly about her. “I don’t know, really, I—”

She leans in and whispers in my ear. Her whispers are sharp gusts of wind, gales, prayers. I can’t interpret any of them. She pulls away, her expression dying into melancholy. My chest burns.

“This girl,” she starts, bringing her cigar to her lips, “what was her name?”

*Natalie*. She lifts her chin to look at me and her doe-eyes quickly turn to wet glass. She slowly brings her hand to mine, reaching for the switchblade. Her thumb twiddles with it, retracting its blade. Her breath fogs the back of my neck.

“Don’t do this, Alan.”

Suddenly it all comes back to me: her habit of tilting her head when she smiled, the constellation of freckles on her face, the warmth of her small hands instilling into mine as she held them, the way she could go on talking for hours, her cosmic red lips: Natalie.

She sets her head on my shoulder. I blink and my eyes fill with tears. She lets out a final breath of gray smoke, swallowing her body whole. When it vanishes, she disappears. I extend my arm and reach for her to no avail. Yet I still feel as though I can trace her with my fingertip.

I pocket my switchblade.

My face crumples.

The sky laughs with something brilliant, something larger than life.

My watch reads a quarter till five. Waist-high fronds of blond grass ripple off into the crowd of aspens brewing in the near distance, filtering scads of light through their branching silhouettes. Lake-blue mountains paint themselves into the horizon. The sky's blood-gutted colors tincture the east.

My body sinks into the gurgling grass field we used to call our hideout. Metal granaries tower into the bleeding sky. The distant shapes of mottled cattle roam within their logged-off enclosures. Crumbling concrete stitches into the slumping swingset by the orchard. Foliage litters the cobbling path, occasionally tumbling over to where I'm sitting. It's the time of year when the flowers begin to wilt and when golden flakes begin to shed from slews of bundling branches. It's quiet. It's like I'm a character that's been brushed into an oil painting. Well, I guess it's always this quiet here, out in the vacant pastures of eastern Idaho. But something's missing from the picture today, something that's been present every time I'm here.

There's a woman walking over to me. She's carefully placing each of her feet into the prickling lashfuls of grass before us. Out gazes meet and she tilts her head to the side, giving a playful smile. She's wearing a stiff canvas jacket the color of bitter saffron. Her doe-shaped eyes flash as she catches sight of me. Her hair is done in twin braids, streaks of port running through them like veins, tied with lace ribbons at the bottoms. She sits down beside me, her frame slipping into the needling stretch of grass beneath. She crosses her legs. Her smile soars.

"Beautiful morning," she says. Her voice is full and lovely.

I'm not much of a talker, but I find myself wanting to hear her voice again. "What brings you here?"

"Hm, just felt like getting some fresh air. Do you come here often?"

"Yeah, I guess."

Her fingertips drum against the smooth, pale knees that poke out from beneath her boxy denim shorts. She's wearing a silver ring on her right hand. Her fingernails are painted Tiffany-blue.

"So why are you wearing that?"

Her gaze traces my body and I flush. I'm dressed for a funeral, wearing a linen button-down and trousers that aren't flattering in the slightest, all black.

I dust off my shirt. "I don't---"

"No. I get it." She tucks a loose strand of dark hair behind her ear, pausing. The rest of her hair flutters frenziedly behind. She zips open one of the large pockets on her jacket and carefully pulls out a box of unlit cigarettes. "Um, I know I don't really know you and all. But how are you doing? How's everything coming along?"

She lights herself a cigarette, setting it into her mouth, puckering her lips just slightly.

She's something yoked from a pleasant dream, a happy memory.

"Everything's been...well."

"Hm?"

"I just---I don't know. Someone close to me just passed and I don't really know what to do. Her funeral was today."

Her face hides in bogs of earl smoke. "Y'know, there was this saying that my folks at home liked to say." She exhales, her breath dying into bogs of gray. Then she purses her lips, stamping her black, flake-tipped cigarette out on the freckled back of her palm. She fumbles with her ring a bit and goes back to running her fingers through her hair.

"They say grief's a medicine of its own."

There's something sweet, something saintly riddled between her words. They have a way of making my breath catch in my throat. They make me forget how tired I am, how I've been up all night, how my life was falling to pieces. She lifts her chin to meet my gaze and smiles. It's like her eyes are melting into mine. "Everything's gonna be fine."

"You're right," I say, running my hand over the coarse sleeves of my button-down. There's something funny about her, about this, about everything. It's like I'm lost in a memory, helplessly toppling into a moment in time when life was bright and sultry. When she was still here.

She seems more fragile, now, as if she'd fall apart at the touch, like a sand castle before a crashing wave. It's like I'm seeing her through a tumblerful of whiskey. "This girl," she starts, bringing her lips to my ear, "what was her name?"

*Natalie*, I want to say, but she stares far ahead and only smiles as if she already knew. She leans in and whispers something in my ear. Her whispers are sharp gusts of wind, gales, prayers. I can't interpret anything she says. Then she pulls away, her expression dying into melancholy. My chest burns. She slowly brings her hand to mine. Natalie's palms are only soft surges of warmth, of affection. I watch as her round eyes melt and turn into glass, her gentle breath fogging the side of my neck. 

"Everything's going to be fine," she says.

And then it all comes back to me. Her habit of tilting her head when she smiled, the warmth of her small hands instilling into mine as he held them, the way she could make me talk as if she drew the words from my throat, her cosmic red lips. The way she presses her head into your shoulder when she feels like crying. The way I'd tell her to drop her smoking habit and she'd only laugh. Us walking in silence over the weed-choked concrete paths. Our scattered violet shadows meeting on stretches of tall flaxen grass.

She sets her head on my shoulder. "I've missed you," Natalie laughs.

But I blink and she's gone. She only disappears with a single puff of gray smoke and my eyes fill with tears. I still feel as though I can trace her with my fingertip. 

"Fuck this," I sigh, pulling out a cigarette myself.

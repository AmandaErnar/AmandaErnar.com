To record my web development journey, I will write down some key terms that I learn on the way. Use this as a cheat sheet for the basic terms you need to know for front-end development.

## Synchronous and Asynchronous Code

Synchronous code will keep running until it hits a piece of asynchronous code that runs on a different thread. An example of such code would be the setTimeout function.

Promise works for the values or results of things that aren't known at the moment. Usually, they're used to anticipate the success/failure values of asynchronous code.

## APIs, Endpoints, and Proxies

An HTTP endpoint, or an endpoint in general, is the end of one line of communication between two things. They are where APIs carry out their functions.

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows two things to communicate with each other via requests and responses, acting as a *contract* of sorts.

A proxy is a class or variable that can be used to represent something else. A proxy server can be used to assign yourself a new IP address to connect to servers that are banned on your own. Servers are entities that speak to one another.

## DOM (Document Object Model)

A DOM is a representation of web code in various nodes and objects so that programming languages can change the page.
